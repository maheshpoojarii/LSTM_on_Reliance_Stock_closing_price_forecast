# LSTM_on_Reliance_Stock_closing_price_forecast
This project aims to predict the closing prices of Reliance Industries' stock using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series forecasting. The dataset consists of historical stock prices, including features like opening price, closing price, volume, high, and low prices, which are used to train the LSTM model. The project involves data preprocessing, such as normalization and feature engineering, to prepare the data for model input. The LSTM model is trained on these features to predict future closing prices, with performance evaluated using metrics like RMSE and MAE. The goal is to forecast stock price trends to support data-driven decision-making. The model's results and accuracy are showcased, and the final model is deployed for real-time prediction capabilities.
